# Neeraj Vijayakumar Pattanashetti

Hi I’m Neeraj. I’m passionate about artificial intelligence and building systems that learn, reason, and help people. I enjoy exploring machine learning, natural language processing, large language models, model evaluation, and the engineering that makes experiments reproducible and production-ready.

- 🔭 Current focus: practical LLM applications, prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, efficient inference, and MLOps pipelines  
- 🧠 Interests: AI/ML research and engineering, NLP, model alignment, data engineering, and reproducible experimentation  
- ⚙️ Skills & tools: Python · Jupyter · PyTorch · TensorFlow · NumPy · pandas · TypeScript · Git · Docker · CI/CD · Experiment tracking (MLflow/Weights & Biases)  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced model alignment techniques, low-latency inference, and scalable deployment patterns

## What I build and how I work
I focus on turning AI ideas into reproducible experiments and reliable systems. I like to:
- Prototype quickly in Jupyter and small experiments, then iterate toward robust pipelines.
- Combine research curiosity with engineering discipline: clear metrics, reproducible runs, and automated CI/CD for models.
- Keep models interpretable, tested, and monitorable once deployed.
