## Neeraj Vijayakumar Pattanashetti

## Hi there 👋,I’m Neeraj. I’m passionate about artificial intelligence and building things that learn, reason, and help people. I enjoy exploring machine learning, large language models, data workflows, and the tooling that makes experiments reproducible and deployable.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: practical applications of LLMs, model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and MLOps pipelines  
- 🧠 Interests: AI / ML, natural language processing, model evaluation, data engineering, and research-oriented problem solving  
- ⚙️ Comfortable with: Python, Jupyter, TypeScript, data analysis, PyTorch/TensorFlow concepts, and modern development workflows  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced model alignment techniques, efficient inference, and scalable model deployment patterns
